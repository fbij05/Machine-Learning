Q1: Is this a regression, classification, or clustering problem?

This dataset is a classification problem because we are trying to put patients into categories. Specifically, we want to know if the patient has heart disease or not. Since the outcome is a category and not a number, it is classification, not regression or clustering.

Q2: Is there a target variable?

Yes, there is a target variable in the dataset. It shows the diagnosis of heart disease. The value tells us whether the disease is absent or present, and sometimes it also indicates how severe the condition is.

Q3: What is the model expected to learn or predict?

The model is expected to learn from the patients’ medical information, such as age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and heart rate. Based on these features, the model predicts whether the patient has heart disease (and in some cases how severe it is).
